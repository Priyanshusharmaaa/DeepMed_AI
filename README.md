DeepMed AI – Multimodal Medical Imaging & Diagnostic Report Assistant
📌 Overview
DeepMed AI is an end-to-end medical imaging platform that assists clinicians by:

Analyzing chest X-ray images using pre-trained deep learning models.

Generating diagnostic reports in .docx format with localized explanations.

Linking clinical phrases to key image regions using phrase grounding.

Incorporating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for evidence-based summaries.

This project combines computer vision, natural language processing, and large language models (LLMs) to create an AI-driven diagnostic assistant.

✅ Features
Disease Prediction: DenseNet121-based classifier for ChestX-ray14 dataset.

Visual Explainability: Grad-CAM and saliency maps for interpretability.

Phrase Grounding: BioViL-T for linking medical terms to image regions.

Report Generation: Automated structured diagnostic reports (.docx).

Synthetic Data Augmentation: Stable Diffusion for generating rare condition images.

RAG-based Explanations: ChromaDB + Gemini / LLaMA for literature-backed insights.

UI: Web app built using Flask + Streamlit.
